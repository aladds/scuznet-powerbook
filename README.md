=======

This is a modified version of the Scuznet board designed to fit in a
PowerBook. Also included is a small PCB for a PowerBook 100's modem 
bay. Otherwise this is fully compatible with a Scuznet V2.


Open source hardware emulating SCSI hard drives and an Ethernet adapter, for
use with vintage Macintosh computers.
